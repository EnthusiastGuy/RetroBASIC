- basic functionality needed to run all games in BASIC Computer Games
- limited to the syntax and features of early MS BASICS like Commodore BASIC 1.x

- added support for ANSI and HP style string slicing
- user defined functions correctly use local variables and expressions
- refactored code into a more cannonical C form
