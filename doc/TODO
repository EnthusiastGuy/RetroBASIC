RetroBASIC TODO/BUGS/ERRATA list

MS = MS BASIC, 6502 40-bit version
HP = HP Time-Sharing BASIC
AB = Atari BASIC
IB = Integer BASIC (Apple BASIC)
GW = GW-BASIC
WB = Wang BASIC
PA = Palo Alto Tiny BASIC

- DEFINT/SNG/DBL/STR does not support the "range" syntax, DEFINT A-F. only comma lists work, DEFINT A,B

- ELSE would be realtively easy to add, at least the single-line variety

- flesh out GET and PUT, which are just placeholders for now

- need to allow multiple INPUTs on a single line, currently it requires a CR between values

- add support for string "slicing" commands used in HP/AB/IB. This is a bit tricky because it is the same syntax as string arrays found in other systems, so there is a command-line switch for this

- support AB's DEG and RAD modes? WB also had gradians; SELECT G

- WB allows a message after a STOP, which is printed when that command runs

- PA allows multiple assignments in a LET, separated by commas, see assignlist

- PA allows single or double quotes around strings

- PA allows # to define field widths in PRINT, so PRINT A,#3,B,C will print B and C in 3-character widths. All expressions following the format use that format until reset by another # or another PRINT

- PA prints a colon after INPUTs, not ?, and prints the variable name if no prompt is given. So "INPUT A" prints "A:", while INPUT "TYPE A NUMBER"A prints "TYPE A NUMBER:"

- LPOS, LPRINT, etc. from AB, GW and others

- file handling, OPEN, PRINT# etc.

- a number of less-commonly-used math and string functions are not yet implemented: CINT CSNG CDBL

- some BASICs allow RESTORE to include a parameter which is the ordinal position in the list, as opposed to a line number

- out-of-range index values in ON statements in MS fall through to the next statement, ANSI returns an error
