RetroBASIC TODO list

MS = MS BASIC, following 6502 40-bit version
HP = HP Time-Sharing BASIC
AB = Atari BASIC
IB = Integer BASIC
PATB = Palo Alto Tiny BASIC

- IF statements follow the MS pattern, where all statements are considered part of the IF
  this is as opposed to the Dartmouth pattern where only the statement after the IF is considered,
  any additional statements on the line will run regardless of the IF
    IF 1=2 THEN PRINT"one";:PRINT"two" will print nothing, whereas Dartmouth would print two

- DEF FN is parsed but not evaluated at runtime

- ELSE would be realtively easy to add, at least the single-line variety

- need to allow multiple INPUTs on a single line, currently it requires a CR between values

- add support for string "slicing" commands used in HP/AB/IB. This is a bit tricky because it is the same syntax as string arrays found in other systems. This might only be possible by using a command-line switch. Alternately, use square brakets for slicing, which would require rewrites for AB/IB.

- support AB's DEG and RAD modes?

- PATB allows multiple assignments in a LET, separated by commas, see assignlist

- PATB allows single or double quotes around strings

- PATB allows # to define field widths in PRINT, so PRINT A,#3,B,C will print B and C in 3-character widths. All expressions following the format use that format until reset by another # or another PRINT

- PATB prints a colon after INPUTs, not ?, and prints the variable name if no prompt is given. So "INPUT A" prints "A:", while INPUT "TYPE A NUMBER"A prints "TYPE A NUMBER:"

- GW-BASIC states that if the last item on a line is a TAB or SPC, it is like having a semicolon, and subsequent PRINTs should be on the same line. we do not currently handle this case

- add support for DEFINT, etc. These are easy, they are essentially identical to DIM, they simply need to call variable_value to insert an entry into the g_tree and set the type correctly

- LPOS, LPRINT, etc.

- file handling, OPEN, PRINT# etc.

- support different TAB widths - Dartmouth was 17, we have 16, GW-BASIC uses 14, --tabs 16?

- add support for OPTION BASE and modify variable_value to handle base 0

- a number of math and string functions are not yet implemented: FIX CINT CSNG CDBL FRE

- some BASICs allow RESTORE to include a parameter. in some versions that reset to the pointer to that line number, in others the number represents the Nth item and sets the pointer there
