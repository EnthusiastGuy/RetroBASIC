RetroBASIC TODO/BUGS/ERRATA list

MS = MS BASIC, 6502 40-bit version
HP = HP Time-Sharing BASIC
AB = Atari BASIC
IB = Integer BASIC (aka Apple BASIC)
GW = GW-BASIC
WB = Wang BASIC
PA = Palo Alto Tiny BASIC
BP - DEC BASIC-PLUS

- add longer variable names

- add slicing-based concat, A[10]=B[5,10] and replacement, A[10,15]="HELLO"

- make POP/EXIT work

- test and error on incorrect nesting of FOR loops, which we currently ignore

- need to allow multiple INPUTs on a single line, currently it requires a CR between values

- DEFINT/SNG/DBL/STR does not support the "range" syntax, DEFINT A-F. only comma lists work, DEFINT A,B

- needs command-line switch for ANSI, controls tab stops and many errors

- support Dartmouth/ANSI style FOR loops which skip the body if the test fails on the first loop

- ELSE would be realtively easy to add, at least the single-line variety

- flesh out GET and PUT, which are just placeholders for now

- add BIN$, HEX$, OCT$ etc

- support AB's DEG and RAD modes? WB also had gradians; SELECT G

- add BPs STRING$(X,Y)/STRING$(X,Y$) which makes a string of length X filled with character with ASCII Y or character Y$

- PA allows multiple assignments in a LET, separated by commas, see assignlist.

- BP (and HP?) allows multiple assignments with equals, A=B=C=10

- PA and BP allow single or double quotes around strings

- PA allows # to define field widths in PRINT, so PRINT A,#3,B,C will print B and C in 3-character widths. All expressions following the format use that format until reset by another # or another PRINT

- PA prints a colon after INPUTs, not ?, and prints the variable name if no prompt is given. So "INPUT A" prints "A:", while INPUT "TYPE A NUMBER"A prints "TYPE A NUMBER:"

- LPOS, LPRINT, etc. from AB, GW and others

- file handling, OPEN, PRINT# etc.

- CINT CSNG CDBL are not implemented

- GW BASIC string formatters in PRINT USING, but number formats work

Debatable:

- backslash for statement separators seen in Multics and BASIC-PLUS. The later requires spaces on either side. Easy to convert to colons, although the formating in BASIC-PLUS documentation is nice.

Will not be done:

- WB allows RESTORE to use an ordinal position in the list, as opposed to a line number. There appears to be no easy way to distinguish this.

- WB uses CONVERT for ASC, which steps on HPs CONVERT

- INPUT LINE is not needed (for now) as all INPUTs are treated as LINE
