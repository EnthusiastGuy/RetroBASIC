RetroBASIC TODO/BUGS/ERRATA list

MS = MS BASIC, following 6502 40-bit version as seen on the PET
HP = HP Time-Sharing BASIC
AB = Atari BASIC
IB = Integer BASIC
GW = GW-BASIC
WB = Wang BASIC
PATB = Palo Alto Tiny BASIC

- numbers do not properly truncate at 9 places on output, formatting is generally janky

- ELSE would be realtively easy to add, at least the single-line variety

- NEW is incomplete, it erases variables and state but not the program lines (easy to fix)

- DEF FN ignores *local* parameters when evaluating the formula, uses global ones instead (fix: add name of function to front of parameter names)

- flesh out GET and PUT, which are just placeholders for now. this should be easy, perhaps reuse the .input and .print structs in statement_t

- need to allow multiple INPUTs on a single line, currently it requires a CR between values

- add support for string "slicing" commands used in HP/AB/IB. This is a bit tricky because it is the same syntax as string arrays found in other systems, so there is a command-line switch for this. Alternately, use square brakets for slicing, which would require rewrites for AB/IB.

- support AB's DEG and RAD modes? WB also had gradians

- WB allows a message after a STOP, which is printed when that command runs

- PATB allows multiple assignments in a LET, separated by commas, see assignlist

- PATB allows single or double quotes around strings

- PATB allows # to define field widths in PRINT, so PRINT A,#3,B,C will print B and C in 3-character widths. All expressions following the format use that format until reset by another # or another PRINT

- PATB prints a colon after INPUTs, not ?, and prints the variable name if no prompt is given. So "INPUT A" prints "A:", while INPUT "TYPE A NUMBER"A prints "TYPE A NUMBER:"

- add support for DEFINT, etc. They are essentially identical to DIM; they need to call variable_value to insert an entry into the g_tree and set the type correctly

- LPOS, LPRINT, etc. from AB, GW and others

- file handling, OPEN, PRINT# etc.

- a number of less-commonly-used math and string functions are not yet implemented: FIX CINT CSNG CDBL

- some BASICs allow RESTORE to include a parameter which is the ordinal position in the list, as opposed to a line number

- IF statements follow the MS pattern, where all statements on the line after the THEN are considered as a unit. This is different than the Dartmouth pattern where only the statement immediately after the THEN is part of the IF. e.g. IF 1=2 THEN PRINT 1:PRINT 2 will print nothing in MS, Dartmouth would print "2"
