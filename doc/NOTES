RetroBASIC NOTES

TB = Tiny BASIC
ATB = Palo Alto Tiny BASIC
AB = Atari BASIC
HP = HP Time Shared BASIC
MS = any of the early Microsoft BASICs
CB = Commodore BASIC
GW = GW-BASIC, similar to earlier MS but with some notable changes

- CB does not allow commas to surpress the ? for INPUT, and always prints a space after it. We do not print the space.

- MS only allows a single prompt in an INPUT, but PATB allows mixtures of prompts and variables. RetroBASIC follows the PATB pattern.

- PATB and other Tiny variants allow a single numeric array known as "@". This is a valid variable name in Retro and should work as expected.
